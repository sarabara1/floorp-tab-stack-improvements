// @name           Stack strip: faster + smooth mouse-wheel scroll
// @include        main
// ==/UserScript==

// Speeds up wheel-scrolling of the overflowed tabs within a stack — the row that
// grows side arrow buttons and scrolls through the tabs when too many fit. This
// does NOT switch tabs; it only scrolls the strip.
//
// The element that actually scrolls is `#floorp-stack-scroller` (a horizontal
// hbox with overflowX; found live via a composedPath wheel probe). It is the
// PARENT of `#floorp-stack-items`, not the strip itself.
//
// Motion model: hand the scroll to Firefox's OWN native smooth-scroll engine via
// `scrollTo({ behavior: "smooth" })` — the exact mechanism the main tab strip
// uses. A probe of that global strip (composedPath sampler, §6) found it to be an
// `<scrollbox smoothscroll="true">` with CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth`, i.e. it
// just defers to Gecko's built-in smooth scroll. Sampling its motion showed a
// quick velocity ramp-up to a peak (~65ms) then a long drawn-out ease-OUT to rest
// (~250ms + tail) — the classic (non-MSD) model tuned by the user's prefs
// `general.smoothScroll.currentVelocityWeighting` (0.25) /
// `stopDecelerationWeighting` (0.4), duration clamped 50–200ms. (msdPhysics was
// FALSE.) By routing the stack strip through the SAME engine we inherit that feel
// by construction and track those prefs automatically, so it scrolls identically
// to the global tabs.
//
// This replaced a hand-rolled cubic-Hermite tween that, from a standstill, eased
// IN (m0 = 0 → smoothstep, a slow start) — the opposite of the native curve's
// fast-start-then-glide, and the "feels a bit wrong" this fixes. Several earlier
// curves (exponential, SmoothDamp, ease-in-out-quad, Hermite) were tried; the
// native engine's asymmetric long-tail ease-out is hard to reproduce by hand, so
// we stop trying and use it directly.
//
// Accumulation: we track our own `dest` (the accumulated target) and drive it
// with ABSOLUTE `scrollTo`, so rapid notches build distance reliably. A relative
// `scrollBy` mid-animation can restart from the lagging rendered position and
// undershoot; retargeting an absolute dest lets the native engine carry velocity
// into the new target (its currentVelocityWeighting), matching a fast global-strip
// spin. `dest` is re-read from the real scrollLeft whenever the pointer moves to
// another stack's scroller OR the strip has been idle longer than the max
// smooth-scroll duration — so an external scroll (tab select, add/remove) can't
// leave `dest` stale and cause a jump on the next notch.
//
// One knob:
//   - SPEED : distance per notch (sensitivity), a multiple of the raw delta.
//             Distance ONLY — the curve and duration come from the native engine
//             (and thus from the smoothScroll prefs), matching the global strip.
