# Floorp Tab Stack Improvements 
The tab stack implementation leaves a lot to be desired. They're clunky and frustrating to use. With the help of ~~vibecoding~~ Agentic Enginnering I've created a set of userscripts (and an optional stylesheet) to make tab stacks practical. The end goal is to make tab stacks as seamless and practical as global tabs, like Vivaldi. **The scripts and stylesheet are modular and self-contained, pick and choose what to add.**

# Recommended
**stacktab-global-drag-fix.uc.js** - Highly recommended. Fixes the dragging of stacks and tabs on the global tab bar. Tabs and stacks can be moved around smoothly without ordering and merge issues. Fixes tabs being merged with stacks when placed after it. Fixes stack tabs so they can be placed between stacks.

**stacktab-mouse-improvements.uc.js** - Context-aware middle click on empty tab bar space to open a new tab. New tabs will open in the stack or global tabs depending on where you click, as well as drag and drop support for text/images/whatever. Dragging tabs from other windows aren't yet supported, but planned.

**stacktab-hotkey-opens-in-stack.uc.js** - Makes the new tab hotkey & gesture context-aware. New tabs are opened in the currently active stack or in the global tab area, depending on which you're using.

**stacktab-inline-newtab-button.uc.js** - Moves the stack's new tab button to the right end of your tabs just like in the global area. It will snap to the window when the tabs overflow like global tabs.

**stacktab-overflow-scroll-speed.uc.js** - Scrolling overflowed tabs within a stack was frustratingly slow. This script makes scrolling behave like the global tabs.

**stacktab-drag-edge-scroll.uc.js** - Allows stack area to auto-scroll while dragging tabs to the edge. Also adds continuous scroll while holding left click on the arrows.

**stacktab-multiselect.uc.js** - Allows selecting multiple tabs from stacks. Useful with stacktab-move-to-group and stacktab-auto-title.

**stacktab-auto-title.uc.js** - When you create a stack the "Manage Stack" options won't automatically appear and stacks will show the name of their active tab. You can still change the name manually, makes stacks vivaldi-like, useful with stacktab-multiselect.uc.js and stacktab-move-to-group-menu.uc.js

**stacktab-move-to-group-menu.uc.js** - Enables the "Add Tab to Group" option to stack tabs.

**stacktab-container-line.uc.js** - Shows the container color under stack tabs like on global tabs.
 
**stacktab-newtab-expand-animation.uc.js** - Adds the opening animation to stack tabs. Purely cosmetic but adds missing polish.

# Optional
**stacktab-close-confirm.uc.js** - Adds a dialog when closing a stack or group if it contains multiple tabs just like windows if "Ask before closing multiple tabs" is enabled in your settings.

**stacktab-unload-context-menu-item.uc.js** - Adds a context menu item for stacks and groups to unload the tabs they contain.

**stacktab-close-last-becomes-newtab.uc.js** - Makes closing the last tab in a stack switch to a new tab page instead of removing the stack. It still allows the stack to be closed on the stack handle itself. This mimics global window behavior. Useful for people who like to keep long-standing stacks and don't want to be careful about accidentally closing one.

**floorp-workspaces-scroll-switch.uc.js.** - Scroll over the workspaces button to quickly switch between them.

**floorp-about-page-singletons.uc.js** - This is the odd one out. It makes the Floorp hub a singleton like the rest of the about: pages. This makes them open in the global tabs and the browser will prefer to switch to existing hubs instead of opening a new one. Simply adds cohesion with the rest of Firefox.

**stackktab-compact-stacks.uc.css** - Makes stacks a bit more compact, between the width of a group and normal tab. Great if you like to have a bunch of assorted stacks.

**floorp-sidebar-resize-fix.us.css** - Fixes unresizable sidebar when using some default Floorp themes.
